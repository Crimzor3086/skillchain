# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SkillChain is a Web3 learning and credentialing platform that enables learners to complete educational challenges, earn blockchain-verified credentials, and store them in a tamper-proof skill passport. The platform combines traditional learning experiences with blockchain technology to create verifiable, portable credentials that learners own and control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Wallet Integration

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to sign up and log in using my Web3 wallet, so that I can securely access the platform and own my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL display wallet connection options (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
2. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using their wallet address
3. WHEN a user disconnects their wallet THEN the system SHALL log them out securely
4. IF a user's wallet is not connected THEN the system SHALL restrict access to authenticated features

### Requirement 2: Learning Quest Management

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to view and select available learning quests, so that I can choose educational content that matches my interests and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all available learning quests
2. WHEN a user clicks on a quest THEN the system SHALL show quest details including requirements, rewards, and estimated time
3. WHEN a user starts a quest THEN the system SHALL track their progress
4. IF a quest has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL only allow access when prerequisites are met

### Requirement 3: Interactive Challenge Completion

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to complete various types of challenges within quests, so that I can demonstrate my knowledge and skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a challenge THEN the system SHALL present the appropriate interface (quiz, upload, or integration)
2. WHEN a user completes a quiz challenge THEN the system SHALL validate answers and provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN a user submits an upload challenge THEN the system SHALL store the submission securely
4. WHEN a user completes all challenges in a quest THEN the system SHALL mark the quest as completed

### Requirement 4: Blockchain Credential Issuance

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to receive blockchain-verified credentials when I complete quests, so that I have tamper-proof evidence of my achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a quest THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate credential minting
2. WHEN a credential is minted THEN the system SHALL create a non-transferable (soulbound) token
3. WHEN credential metadata is created THEN the system SHALL store it on IPFS/Arweave
4. WHEN minting is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user and update their skill passport

### Requirement 5: Skill Passport Profile

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to view all my earned credentials in a consolidated skill passport, so that I can showcase my achievements to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display all earned credentials
2. WHEN a credential is displayed THEN the system SHALL show credential title, date earned, issuer, and verification link
3. WHEN a user shares their profile THEN the system SHALL provide a public URL for verification
4. IF a user has no credentials THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance

### Requirement 6: Third-Party Verification

**User Story:** As an employer or institution, I want to verify a learner's credentials on-chain, so that I can trust the authenticity of their achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verifier accesses a credential link THEN the system SHALL display credential details and blockchain proof
2. WHEN a verifier queries the blockchain THEN the system SHALL return credential ownership status
3. WHEN a credential is verified THEN the system SHALL show issuer information and issuance date
4. IF a credential is invalid or revoked THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this status

### Requirement 7: Quest Content Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to create and manage learning quests, so that I can provide diverse educational content to learners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a quest THEN the system SHALL allow setting title, description, challenges, and rewards
2. WHEN an admin publishes a quest THEN the system SHALL make it available to learners
3. WHEN an admin updates a quest THEN the system SHALL preserve existing learner progress where possible
4. IF a quest is deprecated THEN the system SHALL prevent new enrollments while preserving existing credentials

### Requirement 8: API Integration Support

**User Story:** As a third-party platform, I want to integrate with SkillChain through APIs, so that I can issue credentials for completions on my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a third-party makes an API request THEN the system SHALL authenticate using API keys
2. WHEN a valid completion is submitted THEN the system SHALL initiate credential issuance
3. WHEN API integration is configured THEN the system SHALL support webhook notifications
4. IF API limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate rate limiting responses

### Requirement 9: Smart Contract Security and Upgradability

**User Story:** As a platform stakeholder, I want the smart contracts to be secure and upgradable, so that the platform can evolve while protecting user assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL implement access controls and security patterns
2. WHEN contracts need updates THEN the system SHALL support proxy-based upgrades
3. WHEN security issues are identified THEN the system SHALL allow emergency pausing
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction

### Requirement 10: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to access SkillChain from different devices and browsers, so that I can learn flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface
2. WHEN a user switches devices THEN the system SHALL maintain their session and progress
3. WHEN different wallet types are used THEN the system SHALL support multiple wallet providers
4. IF browser compatibility issues exist THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings
